Technical Requirements

1. Backend – Django
   Django for handling backend logic and user authentication.

Django REST Framework (DRF) to create APIs for sending location data and getting recommendations.

Django Channels (optional, for real-time features like live updates).

2. Database – PostgreSQL
   Store user info: name, email, device ID, etc.

Store geolocation: latitude, longitude, timestamp, and location name (optional).

Create models to link users and their location history.

3. Frontend – Mobile Web App
   Use HTML5 Geolocation API to fetch location from mobile browsers.

JavaScript/React/Vue (optional) to call backend APIs and show location info.

Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for mobile responsiveness.

4. Real-Time or Periodic Location Updates
   Periodic API calls (e.g., every 30 seconds) to update location.

WebSocket (Django Channels) for real-time updates, if needed.

Celery (optional) for periodic tasks like checking crowd size at each location.

5. Location Recommendation Logic
   Backend logic to count how many users are currently at/near a specific location.

If count > threshold → "Too crowded, don’t go".

If count ≤ threshold → "It’s fine to go".

6. Security & Privacy
   JWT or Django session-based login system.

Secure handling of user location data (HTTPS, user consent, etc).

User must explicitly allow location access.

7. Deployment
   Host Django on services like Heroku, Railway, or Render.

PostgreSQL can be hosted on Supabase, ElephantSQL, or the same platform as Django.

Use Nginx/Gunicorn if deploying manually.
