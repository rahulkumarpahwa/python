# note : don't put the if condition in the while reading the file, other whole file will be deleted.

# reason : 
# if "donkey" in f.read():
#     content = f.read()
# Problem: f.read() Moves the File Pointer
# When you call f.read(), it reads the entire file and moves the file pointer to the end. So when you try to read it again with content = f.read(), thereâ€™s nothing left to read, and content becomes an empty string.
